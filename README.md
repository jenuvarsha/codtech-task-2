# codtech-task-2
The purpose of code is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous  target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared  error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy

To implement a simple linear regression model using Python, we'll follow these steps:

1)Load and Prepare the Dataset
2)Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
3)Train the Linear Regression Model
4)Evaluate the Model
5)Make Predictions and Visualize Results
The output is as follows:
