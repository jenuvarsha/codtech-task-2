# codtech-task-2
The purpose of code is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous  target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared  error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy

To implement a simple linear regression model using Python, we'll follow these steps:

1)Load and Prepare the Dataset
2)Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
3)Train the Linear Regression Model
4)Evaluate the Model
5)Make Predictions and Visualize Results
